        <h1>Planets</h1>
        <p>Explore our solar system, a captivating cosmic neighborhood that revolves around the Sun. At the heart of it all is our radiant star, the Sun, a blazing ball of gas that orchestrates the gravitational dance of planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.</p><br>
        <p>Our solar system boasts eight unique planets, each with its own distinct characteristics. The inner, rocky planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—offer a glimpse into the terrestrial wonders of our cosmic neighborhood. Meanwhile, the outer giants—Jupiter and Saturn—dominate with their massive atmospheres primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The distant ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, add an intriguing touch with their chilly atmospheres and captivating features.</p>
